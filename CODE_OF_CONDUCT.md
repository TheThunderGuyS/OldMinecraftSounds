# Code of Conduct
> TheThunderGuyS v1.0.1, September 17th, 2019.
**********************
# Summary
*Old Minecraft Sounds* is a fan project created for all to share, contribute to and be productive in. 
It should be a safe enviroment for all contributors and visitors. 
I will not tolerate any form of discrimination of *any* kind; whether it be racism, gender inequality or disibility. 
All opinions should be appropriate for all viewers. 

Any inapropriate language/imagery (vulgur/heavy swearing) or harassment is highly punishable.
If anyone you catch anyone doing this, please report it to me. (See [Reporting an incident.)](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md#reporting-a-incident)

Other than that you should be:
- Kind, friendly and welcoming to newcomers.
- Patient when waiting for a response. Some people might have other lives to live and be unable to reply.
- Respectful to other's property and beliefs. It was mentioned this above but I can't stress this enough.
- Not malicious. We don't want to be the center of a crime scene. Please don't be a online predator.
- Not putting others down. Making others feel worthless to make yourself feel powerful is a poor way to live life.
- Having fun! This doesn't have to be a formal, professinal enviroment at all times. Some joking is okay.

Some people might not agree with what you say, you need to remember that it is okay. 
It's human nature to disagree but it's wrong to argue and fight over it.
