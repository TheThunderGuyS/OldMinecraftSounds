        <h3 class="Text">Old Minecraft Sounds is a Minecraft resource pack that attempts to bring old sounds back into modern versions. <br>It's a fan project created by me, in an attempt to create one place where we can accurately share the knowledge and the experience of old Minecraft.</h3>
        <h3 class="Text">All of the project is open and you are free to copy or contribute to it on my GitHub page. <br>This project was inspired by the fact that many old sounds are now lost or hard to find. <br>Compilations of old sounds are generally done poorly and incorrectly and the goal of this is to develop the best possible, free and open solution.</h3>
